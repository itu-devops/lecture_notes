* https://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-alongside-with-windows/
* https://vitux.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-18-04-along-with-windows-10/

== Installing Linux on Harddisk (MacOS Dual Boot)

* For older Macs (without Touchbar):
https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-dual-boot-ubuntu-mac/
* For newer Macs (with Touchbar):
** First check if the Wifi card of your model is supported:
https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux#wi-fi
** If yes: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/375863
** If not, either:
***  Install in a Virtual Machine (see below), or
*** Install on another old computer that you can use for this course.
* For Macs with M1 processor:
** There is not full support yet, but you can try one of these alternatives:
*** Use [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) and virtualize Ubuntu for ARM: https://docs.getutm.app/guides/ubuntu/ (recommended)
**** You can also try to [install Pop!_OS on top of Ubuntu](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1B3uwutmaFCknzo-_c1jme5oOeJ-mdvxhoH5CKamZg/pub)
*** Use [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) and emulate Pop!_OS (this can be slow).

== Installing Linux as Virtual Machine

In case non of the above options of installing Linux are an option for you, you might want to install Linux in a Virtual Machine (VM). Be aware however, that not all contents of the lecture (virtualization part in session 3) may work in a VM

=== VirtualBox (for both macOS and Windows)
  * https://support.system76.com/articles/install-in-vm/

=== VMware Fusion (for macOS)

VMware Fusion is a great hypervisor for the macOS operating system, and is offered as a free service for all ITU students.

  * Download the VMware Fusion 12.x client and get your license from link:https://itudk.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=6597520e-2ffc-ea11-812f-000d3af41938[InstallIT]. You will have to use your ITU credentials to log in.
  * Follow the installation instructions as mentioned in link:https://www.askdavetaylor.com/install-ubuntu-linux-vmware-fusion-mac/[this article]. Restart your machine after completion.
  ** NOTE: It is important that you grant the VMware Fusion application the access that it needs when prompted during the installation.
  * Enabling virtualization in the Settings menu as described in link:http://techgenix.com/vmware-fusion-5-enable-vt-xept-inside-a-virtual-machine-288/[this article].

Troubleshooting:
  * If you get this following this error message (`cannot open /dev/vmmon`) when booting on your newly created Linux image, then follow these steps:
  ** Close the VMware Fusion application.
  ** Go To *System Preferences* -> *Security & Privacy* -> Check if you're allowed to run apps from identified developers and there is no mentioning of a block application.
